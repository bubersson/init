Transfer iterm2 preferences. First get old preferences from `~/.config/iterm2` (or whatever configured folder), then move those to new laptop:
```
cd .config ; mkdir iterm2
```
In iterm2 go to `Preferences > General > Preferences` and enable both loading and saving from the folder (may need to copypaste the hidden path).

The preferences include making ⌘+left, ⌘+right work, also can be found here:
